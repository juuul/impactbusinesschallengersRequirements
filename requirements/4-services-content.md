## Business Challenges

Some challenges are too complex to treat as a single project. It touches culture, processes, leadership, and sometimes even strategy. We are often asked when previous attempts have yielded insufficient results.

### Typical Challenges
- Implementations that get stuck
- Poor collaboration between departments
- Culture and behavior problems that block change
- IT systems that are not or hardly adopted
- Strategy that is not executed in practice

### Approach
1. **Diagnosis** – Discover where the real bottleneck is
2. **Direction** – Clarify choices, priorities, and scenarios
3. **Movement** – Activate teams, accelerate decision-making
4. **Anchoring** – Secure new structure, working method, and behavior
