# Cases Structure

Each case is built according to a fixed structure:

1. **The Challenge** – What was really going on?
2. **Our Role** – What contribution did we make?
3. **Approach** – What steps did we take?
4. **Result** – Concrete improvements, KPIs, or behavior changes

Cases must be easily manageable in the CMS (create, edit, delete).
